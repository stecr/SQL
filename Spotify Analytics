-- I used a dataset from Kaggle to create a table and explore its data. It is a .csv file containing the Top 50 songs in 2021 on
--Spotify and different attributes for each song.

-- I first created a table to insert the Spotify table.
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--After inserting the data into the table, I came up with a few questions I was interested in finding out from the data and wrote some
--SQL queries.

-- Which artists have more than one song in the Top 50 List, how many songs do they have, and what is the average popularity of their songs?
--Order the results by average popularity.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(id) AS 'Number of Songs', AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING `Number of Songs`>1
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc;

-- What are the top 10 most danceable songs? What is their position in the Top 50 List (Top 25 or Bottom 25)?
SELECT track_name,artist_name, danceability, 
CASE    WHEN id<=25 THEN 'Top 25'
        WHEN id>25 THEN 'Bottom 25'
        ELSE 'No position'   
    END as 'Top or Bottom 25'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

-- What is the most common song key in the Top 50 List? Which songs are in that key?
-- Data Description from Kaggle: "Key - the key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. 
-- E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1 (range: -1; 11)"
-- Interestingly, C♯/D♭ was the most common key with 8 songs.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, song_key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key =
(SELECT song_key
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY song_key
  ORDER BY COUNT(id) desc
  LIMIT 1);
