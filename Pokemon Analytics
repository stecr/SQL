-- Using this Pokemon data set << https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/26b9357c6120d3d0d27c2b90c950e8c6 >> I came up with a few questions and queries 
-- to discover some new things and reorganize the table for different uses.

-- My Queries

-- Which pokemon would be good against a fire type with 100 HP (Ground, rock, water are weaknesses)? Ordered by high to low attack.
SELECT Name, Type_1 as 'Type 1', Type_2 as 'Type 2',Attack, HP
FROM pokemon
WHERE (Type_1 in ('Ground', 'Rock', 'Water') OR Type_2 in ('Ground', 'Rock', 'Water', Null))
	AND HP > 100
ORDER BY Attack desc;



-- Which water-type pokemon have the strongest special attack? Compared to all Pokemon, are they faster or slower than average?
SELECT Name, Sp_Atk,
		 CASE WHEN (SELECT avg(Speed) FROM pokemon) < Speed THEN 'Fast'
		 WHEN (SELECT avg(Speed) FROM pokemon) > Speed THEN 'Slow'
             ELSE 'Average'
		 END as 'Speed Compared to Average'
FROM pokemon
WHERE (Type_1 = 'Water' OR Type_2 = 'Water') AND Sp_Atk >=90
ORDER BY Sp_Atk desc;



-- How many single and dual types are there?
SELECT SUM(Type_2 is null) as 'Number of Single Types', SUM(Type_2 is not null) as 'Number of Dual Types'
FROM pokemon;



-- What types would each pokemon be good against? (Note: normal types aren't effective to any type)
SELECT Number,Name, Type_1,
	CASE WHEN Type_1 = 'Normal' THEN 'Not super effective'

	ELSE 'No information on this type available.'
    END as 'Type 2 Strong Against'
FROM pokemon;



-- How many legendary pokemon are there per generation? What are their average stats? Does each generation get stronger?
SELECT Generation, COUNT(*) as 'Number of Legendaries per Generation', avg(total), avg(HP), avg(Attack), avg(Defense),
		avg(Sp_Atk), avg(Sp_Def), avg(Speed)
FROM pokemon
WHERE Legendary = 'True'
GROUP BY Generation;
